# Digital-Health-R-studio-final-project
This Repository will be a compilation of my raw data file that I started with, the updated dataset with python and the codes used to manipulate the data set, My R-files, shiny-app files/URL, and my report.

I started with Burnout_xlsx file which I generated from ChatGPT and then edited it to Burnout_Modified2.csv on Python, with the steps specified in the Jupiter notebook file "Kaleb_Data_set_Edot.ipynb" then the "Burnout_Modified2.csv" file was cleaned and saved as "Cleaned_Burnout_Modified2.csv" which was used for the shiny app, which run the visualization code. The final product is this link here "https://caleblak.shinyapps.io/Kaleb_Final/_w_d2f715ea/#tab-4562-3"
